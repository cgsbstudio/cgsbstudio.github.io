                <p>Stewart Bird works in interactive audio/visual software, music production/sound design, 3D production, motion graphics, exhibition design, and new media art. He spent his early twenties building 8-Channel immersive sound installations internationally with prominent Fluxus composer Charlie Morrow, and his production company, MorrowSound. Stewart has a Masters in Fine Arts from Pratt Institute, a Bachelors in Emergent Digital Practices with an emphasis on Max MSP from the University of Denver, and attended the Red Bull Music Academy: Studio Science in New York and the Institut For (x) residency in Aarhus, Denmark for audio composition. As a musician he has been featured in Resident Advisor, Fact Magazine, Dummy Magazine, Spin Magazine, and his media appearances include NTS, Boiler Room, The Lot Radio, BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra. Alongside his music experience, Stewart specializes in technical multimedia production, exploring the intersection between audio, 3D graphics, web based interactivity, game development, and animation. He believes creative potency exists on the margins between multiple toolsets, and the ability to complete production work from end to end gives his output a strong sense of cohesion and character.</p>
