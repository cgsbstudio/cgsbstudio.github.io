                <p><strong>Stewart Bird</strong> is a creative director, designer, and artist who specializes in technical multimedia production, exploring the intersection between 3D production, animation, web based interactivity, audio, exhibition design, and game development. After receiving a Masters in Fine Arts from Pratt Institute, Stewart joined the Hong Kong-based design firm, ioio, where he specialized in 3D modeling, multimedia, and exhibition design. Stewart began his career producing and playing music, while also building 8-Channel immersive sound installations internationally with prominent Fluxus composer Charlie Morrow (MorrowSound). He has been featured in Resident Advisor, Fact Magazine, Dummy Magazine, Spin Magazine, and his media appearances include NTS, Boiler Room, The Lot Radio, BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra. He received a Bachelors in Emergent Digital Practices with an emphasis on Max MSP from the University of Denver, and attended the Red Bull Music Academy: Studio Science in New York and the Institut For (x) residency in Aarhus, Denmark for audio composition. He believes creative potency exists on the margins between multiple toolsets, and the ability to complete production work from end to end gives his output a strong sense of cohesion and character.</p>
